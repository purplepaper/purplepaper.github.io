summary:    Why "African Time" exists

A curious friend asked me the other day: "why are Africans almost always late for parties?" I explained to her that different cultures have different perceptions of time but I didn't get the chance to fully explain what I meant by that. I'll try to do that here.

### Task Emphasis
In many African cultures, more emphasis is put on the task at hand, instead of the time it takes to complete the task. For example, if there was a bus route between point A and B, the bus would have to reach a certain capacity before leaving A to go to B. On the other hand, in a western country, there would be a fixed schedule at which the bus will leave A regardless of how many people are in the bus. These African cultures put more emphasis on the task (i.e. filling the bus) than a scheduled time for the bus to leave the station.

This task emphasis can also be observed in the way African businesses charge for services.
