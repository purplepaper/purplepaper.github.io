A __couple__ years ago, I built a blog and told all my friends about it. The sad this is that I never actually got around to putting any content on it. A few weeks ago, I ran into an old friend who reminded me that I did not deliver on my promise. I felt so bad that I decided to build this blog.

I will deliver this time. I will ensure this by posting at least four entries before telling anybody - even the friend that reminded me of this promise. 

As before, I'm not sure what I'll be posting here. My brain is very noisy and this is my sounding board. I'll say random things and see what sticks.

### Aside
The word __couple__ has always felt weired to me. In certain parts of the world, it means __few__ while meaning __two__ in other parts.
